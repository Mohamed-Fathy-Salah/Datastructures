     * Another simple sort is the odd-even sort. The idea is to repeatedly make two
     * passes through the array. On the first pass you look at all the pairs of
     * items, a[j] and a[j+1], where j is odd (j = 1, 3, 5, ...). If their key
     * values are out of order, you swap them. On the second pass you do the same
     * for all the even values (j = 2, 4, 6, ...). You do these two passes
     * repeatedly until the array is sorted. Replace the bubbleSort() method with an
     * oddEvenSort() method. Make sure it works for varying amounts of data. Youâ€™ll
     * need to figure out how many times to do the two passes.
